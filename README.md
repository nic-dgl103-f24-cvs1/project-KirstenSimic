<h1>Comox Valley Farmers Market</h1>
<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<h3>What site you have chosen to redesign and build?</h3>
<p> I chose the Comox Valley Farmers Market for my project to rebuild and redesign due to many factors. I love to go to the farmers market on Saturday, but I've found that their website is not well organized and difficult to go through. On top of that the mobile version of the website is the same as the desktop version, which makes it difficult to navigate on the go. </p>

<h3>Why do they need a new website?</h3>
<h4>What is the most important purpose of this website</h4>
<p>The most important purpose of this website is to redirect and inform people and vendors about the Comox Valley Farmers Market.</p>
<h4>Who is the target audience</h4>
<p>There are two target audiences of this website. There are the vendors, which includes current and prospective vendors of the farmers market and ensuring that ther products are adequately advertised. There is also the people attending the farmers market to shop. This could be locals who regularly shop at the farmers market and tourists looking to see our local fares.</p>
<h4>What is the overall message you are trying to convey to your target audience on this website? What action do you want the audience to perform before they leave your website? Are there multiple ways they could take action?</h4>
<p>The overall message is to draw people and vendors in to participate in the Comox Valley Farmer's Market. Ideally you would have vendors apply to be included in the farmers market and also draw people in to shop and redirct them to the farmers market. Currently there are multiple ways within the website to be able to do both of these actions.</p>
<h4>Why is their current site not appropriate?</h4>
<p>Currently, just on the home page there are 40 Different Errors, 5 Contrast Errors, and 35 Alerts.

<p>Most of the errors are alt text errors and when looking at the code you can see why. Currently the alt text doesn't describe what the image is. A simpler alt text for example like "Carrots and Beets" would make much more sense </p>

<p> There are also a few empty headers as well, which seems very unnescessary.

<p>Unfortunately, there were a few contast issues where the background and text were not visible, for example here where the button is a light green and white text. Had they followed the same colour screen as next to it there would be less issues.

<p>The lighthouse report unfortunately was not great as well, with the speed being affected likely due to the excess of unused CSS and the never-ending load of blog posts on the homepage.</p>

The content on the page is not well organized and an excess of repeated information throughout the website, where a link to another part of the website could have been sufficient. When you switch from desktop to mobile the same informaton is shown, when ultimately not all of it was necessary on the mobile version of the site.</p>
